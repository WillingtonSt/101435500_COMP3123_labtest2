IMPORTANT: The 16 Day Forecast Feature is not included in the free account offered by the OpenWeather API service. I used the 5 day weather forecast as that is offered for free.
https://openweathermap.org/forecast5



The app allows the user to dynamically enter the name of a city. It will then make two separate API calls. 

One to retrieve the current weather conditions of the inputted city

and one to retrieve the forecast for the coming week.

The information is dynamically displayed, so users can enter different city names and get different weather forecasts for those cities.
